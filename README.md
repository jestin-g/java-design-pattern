# java-design-pattern
GoF Design patterns implementations based on [Dmitri Nesteruk's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-java/) on Udemy.

## Patterns definitions

- **Builder** *When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly*.
- **Factory** *A component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects*.
- **Singleton** *A component which is instantiated only once*.
- **Composite** *A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner*.
- **Adapter** *A construct which adapts an exisiting interface X to conform to the required interface Y*.
- **State** *A pattern in which the object's behavior is determined by its state. An object transitions from one state to another (something needs to trigger a transition). A formalized construct which manage state and transitions is called a state machine*.
